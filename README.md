# mind-whiteboard-v1

> Privacy-first collaborative whiteboard — **draw** in the browser, **share** a link, **live-collaborate**. Your board lives in your Solid Pod.

See [`docs/PRD.md`](docs/PRD.md) for the full plan, architecture, and decision log. Agents: read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) before editing.

**Status:** M0–M5 built and verified end-to-end. **W1 (draw+persist)** ✅ and **W2 (share)** ✅ pass live; **W3 (live collaborate)** is ⚠️ partial — viewing a shared board + live cursors work, but friend-side *interactive editing* has an open bug. See [`docs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md`](docs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md) (WB-1) for root cause + fix location before relying on two-way live editing.

## The three wishes

1. **Draw** — freehand, shapes, text on an infinite canvas; auto-saved to your pod. ✅
2. **Share** — one link, sent to a friend, carries everything they need. ✅
3. **Live collaborate** — both draw at once, with live cursors and no lag. ⚠️ *cursors + read-only sync work; friend-side editing: see [`docs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md`](docs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md).*

## Stack at a glance

- **Canvas:** Excalidraw (MIT) · **Sync:** Yjs CRDT · **Transport:** `y-websocket` relay (ephemeral)
- **Durable copy:** debounced, E2E-encrypted snapshots to the owner's pod
- **Identity/UI:** `@mind-studio/core` (`MindLoginCard`) + `@mind-studio/ui` (Mind brand, amber accent)
- **Pod host:** CommunitySolidServer v7
- **Ports:** app `:3110` · local CSS `:3111` · relay `:3112`

The pod is the source of truth; the relay is a dumb, disposable pipe. See the PRD §3 for why.

## Develop

```bash
# Install. @mind-studio/* lives on GitHub Packages and needs a token:
NODE_AUTH_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" npm install

# Run the app (Next.js, :3110)
npm run dev

# Run the ephemeral relay (:3112) — needed for live collaboration
npm run relay

# Seed demo personas (alice/bob) into the pods — idempotent
npm run seed:demo

# Production build (NEXT_PUBLIC_* is inlined at build time — set env first)
npm run build
```

For local live collaboration, run **both** `npm run dev` and `npm run relay`.

### Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and adjust. All config flows through `src/lib/config.ts`:

| Var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLID_ISSUER` | `https://pod.mindpods.org/` | OIDC issuer for pod sign-in (prod pod → silent SSO across siblings; point at `http://localhost:3111/` for fully-local dev) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_RELAY_URL` | `ws://localhost:3112` | Ephemeral `y-websocket` relay |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_WHITEBOARD_NAMESPACE` | `mind-whiteboard` | Pod namespace; boards live under `<pod>/<namespace>/boards/` |

`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are baked in when the dev server starts — restart and hard-reload tabs after changing them.

## Notes

- This is a **sibling** prototype in `mind-prototypes/` — independent app, own ports and data. The family's ports collide by design; run one prototype at a time (or override with `npm run dev -- --port NNNN`).
- `@mind-studio/core` is consumed from the registry (`^0.1.1`), like every deployed sibling, so the prod image builds (a `file:` tarball can't be reached inside the Docker build context). See [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) hard-rule 1 and [`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for the deploy story and the other hard-won constraints.
- **Deploying?** [`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) is the plan to ship to `whiteboard.mindpods.org` (+ the relay at `whiteboard-relay.mindpods.org`). Part A (standalone output, Dockerfiles, CI) is done in-repo; infra/DNS/deploy are the remaining steps.
